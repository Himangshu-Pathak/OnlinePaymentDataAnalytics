# Online Payment Data Web App

This is a basic web-app that displays a data set obtained from Kaggle about Online Payment Fraud Detection. The dataset has 11 columns but one can particularly understand the correlation between the different paramters - "Type of Payment", "Amount transacted", "Is it a fraudulent transaction", "has it been flagged as a fraudulent transaction". This correlation can be inferred by selecting multiple columns in the tables and from the pie chart.
