This web-app displays a data set obtained from Kaggle about Online Payment Fraud Detection. The dataset has 11 columns but one can particularly understand the correlation between the different paramters - "Type of Payment", "Amount transacted", "Is it a fraudulent transaction", "has it been flagged as a fraudulent transaction". This correlation can be inferred by selecting multiple columns in the tables and from the pie chart.


The app has been built using Python and Streamlit primarily, but also involves the use of pandas to import the .csv file. The app currently has not been deployed. This is being worked on and the link will be posted soon.
